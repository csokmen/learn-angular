# Learn Angular Project

This project is a guide to learning the basic and advanced concepts of Angular. The topics are ordered from simple to complex. You can check the commit of any subject to see code modifications done for that subject.

## 1. Components

Components are the main building blocks of Angular applications. Each component consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and CSS styles. The `@Component` decorator marks a class as a component, and its metadata specifies the template and styles.

## 2. Data Binding

Data binding allows you to connect your component's data (the class) with its view (the HTML template). This enables you to display data and respond to user events.

*   **Interpolation `{{ }}`:** One-way data binding that displays component data in the template.
*   **Property Binding `[ ]`:** One-way data binding that sets a property of a DOM element to a component's data value.
*   **Event Binding `( )`:** Binds a user event (like a click or keystroke) to a method in your component.
